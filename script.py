# Hello-Python! 

intro_one = "Hello World"
mean_it = "!"
new_lang = " Time to Learn"

print("This is when you say " + intro_one + mean_it + new_lang + mean_it)

# And on to the human!

my_name = "Tony Martinez"

print("And hello and welcome " + my_name + "!")

# Is is it hashtag or a pound sign? Neither. It's how you comment!
# This is a demostration of how to comment within a python program.

#
# So we begin! As seen above 'print' is used. One more time, keep it simple.
# Be sure to use proper syntax! ("")

# Print and Strings
print("Hello World!") # This is a string

print("This is a string") # This is a string

# Print, Strings, and Variables

tech_talk = " I was stored in tech talk, variable one! " # This is a variable one.
tech_talk_2 = " and I was stored tech talk two! "  # Yes, and this is a variable. Variable two.

print("Here's whats stored in variable one -" + tech_talk +".And here's whats stored in variable 2 - " + tech_talk_2)

# Variables can have two underscores "_" in their syntax but you can start a varibale was a digit. Ex. 1,2,3 ect.

# Printing, Strings, and Variable - Example from codeacademy below!

# Updating a Menu!

# We've defined the variable "meal" here to the name of the food we ate for breakfast!
meal = "Omlette"

# Printing out breakfast
print("Breakfast:") # Printing "Breakfast" and then printing "meal"
print(meal)

# ~OR~ 

# Now update meal to be lunch!
meal = "Sandwich"

# Printing out lunch
print("Lunch: Sandwich") #Took away the second print and merged it into the first. Keeping it one line in the output.

# Now update "meal" to be dinner
meal = "Steak"
plus = "&"
side = "Baked Potato"

# ~OR~

# Printing out dinner
print("Dinner:") # Or just making using multiple print and variables.
print(meal)
print(plus)
print(side)
